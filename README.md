This is my completed landing page project using flexbox for the layout. The general theme was if "Learn to code" had a landing page. I wanted to focus solely on flexbox and what I learned in the previous sections.

While reviewing the design, I started with creating all my html elements first, then used ChatGPT to generate the actual contents around the "Learn to code" theme.

I went about tackling the CSS in two phases. Applying all the non-layout css first. Then moved on to applying the layout one section at a time starting from the top.
